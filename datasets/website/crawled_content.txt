erwin DI
 Cloud Configuration


erwin Data Intelligence
 Cloud platform is designed to streamline your data accessibility and management. 
erwin DI
 Cloud enables you to govern organization data, track lineages, and manage the assets effectively within and outside firewall zones.


erwin DI
 Cloud works like any other SaaS-based application outside the firewall zone without any restrictions or configuration. For 
erwin DI
 Cloud to connect to data sources within the firewall zone, you need to deploy 
erwin DI
 instance on the server and configure it with the cloud instance.


This topic will walk you through configuring the 
erwin DI
 Cloud within the firewall zone where the instance cannot access or connect to the data sources.


See the architectural diagram below to understand how to configure both instances for data replication and sync.








 The following list gives a high-level understanding of how 
erwin DI
 Cloud is configured within the firewall zone in a sequence:




Deploy 
erwin DI
 on-premises (local agent) on an organizationâs server.


Login to the 
erwin DI
 Cloud instance and generate an authentication token.


Establish a connection (on the on-premises instance) between the on-premises and cloud instance using the authentication token and create an Instance Data Replication (IDR) instance.


Select the required data on the on-premises instance for data replication.


Schedule a  job in the on-premises instance to sync the data on the cloud instance.

Searching and Filtering


For efficient asset discovery, the Discover Assets module provides extensive search and filter options. Apart from the predefined filter set, you can  configure extended properties of technical and business assets as  filters. You can use them to 
search for assets based on custom fields
. Additionally, you can also 
save your searches as custom views
 to access them quickly in the future.


To search and filter assets, follow these steps:




In the search box, type a keyword. A list of related search terms appears. Select the required search term or enter a new one.




Two options, Like and Exact, appear. Use these options to narrow down the search results.




Like




Use this option to find assets that match a part of the search keyword.




Exact




Use this option to find assets that exactly match the search keyword.






Click 
 or press 
Enter
.


Based on your search criteria, search results appear. 


For example, in the following image, 442 results are displayed for a Like search with keyword, Customer.








In the search box, click 
All
 and select your asset type to filter search results further based on asset types. For example, Columns.


The list of available filters changes depending on asset type.


For example, for the keyword, Customer, and asset type, Columns, the Like search displays 294 results. Apart from the asset type, search results also display sensitivity classifications, tags, ratings, and workflow status.


Executing a Like search for a column displays results based on partial matches found in column name, logical column name, column definition, column comments, expanded logical name, and user-defined fields. 








In the search box, click 
Columns
 and Select 
All
 to filter and search through all asset types.


In the filters pane under 
Data Value Score
, select score classifications, and then click 
Apply Filters
.


The selected classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results. You can view data value scores for different assets here based on the classifications you have selected in the Applied Filters list. 


For example, in the following image, Bronze and Silver are added to the Applied Filters list, and the search result narrows down to 7 results.








In the filters pane under 
Maturity Level
, select maturity level classifications, and then click 
Apply Filters
. 
					
The selected classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.
 You can view maturity level certification for different assets here based on the classifications you have selected in the Applied Filters list. 
For example, in the following image, Beginner and Intermediate are added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 4 results.


Additionally, to view the data value score and maturity level for a particular asset, under 
Asset Type
, select the asset and then click 
Apply Filters
.


The selected asset is added to the Applied Filters list and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results. You can view data value score and maturity level for a particular asset here based on the classification and asset type you have selected in the Applied Filters list.


For example, in the following image, Business Terms is added to the Applied Filters list along with Bronze and Intermediate, and the search result narrows down to 2 results.








Data Value Score and Maturity Level Certification are available for business and data marketplace assets such as business terms, business policies, datasets, and AI models.


In the filters pane under 
Database Type
, select databases, and then click 
Apply Filters
.


The selected databases are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.


For example, in the following image, SqlServer and Oracle are added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 164 results.








Under 
Sensitivity Classification
, select sensitivity tags, and then click 
Apply Filters
.


The selected sensitivity classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.


For example, in the following image, a sensitivity classification, Confidential, is added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 13 records.








Under 
Tags
, select user-defined tags, and then click 
Apply Filters
.


The selected tags are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search result.


For example, in the following image, a tag, Data Quality, is added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 34 results.








Switch

For example, in the following image, My Favourites is added to the Applied Filters list, and the search result narrows down to 2 results.


Similarly, you can apply other filters available for an asset to narrow down search results.








Click 
<Asset_Name>
 to view asset properties.


For example, in the following image, the properties of a column, CustomerTypeID are displayed.










Filtering Assets using Extended Properties


 You can configure extended properties of technical and business assets as filters and use them to filter assets. 


To configure an extended property and use it in the Discover Assets module as filters, refer to the configuring extended properties for 
business
 and 
technical
 assets topics.


Ensure that the:




Filter feature supports field types such dropdown, list, checkbox, radio, and boolean.


Switch the 
Include Extended Properties
 option 
ON
 on the 
Discover Asset Settings
 page.


 Schedule a 
synchronization job
 or manually synchronize
 the asset before you can filter assets on the Discover Assets module.




To filter assets based on the extended properties, follow these steps:




Based on the selection on the Discover Assets dashboard, results are displayed.










 In the filter pane, the available custom filters appear below the default filter options. Custom filters are displayed in blue color. 


In the filter pane, expand custom filters, select a filter parameter, and then click 
Apply Filters
.
The selected parameters are added in the Applied Filters list and matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.
For example, in the following image, CustomerAddress and CustomerNumber from the Must Include parameter are added to the Applied Filters list. This narrows the search results down to three results.
 


Saving Searches as Custom Views

Configuring Asset Form


Assets  are the business assets (business terms, business rules, business policy, and so on) that you work on in the Business Glossary Manager, and marketplace assets (datasets) in the Data Marketplace module. For each asset type, apart from its default properties, you can configure custom properties. To do so, design a form and configure the custom properties on the <Asset Type> tab. By default, all the settings open in the read-only mode.


The following steps walk you through configuring asset forms for business assets. Similarly, you can configure asset forms for marketplace assets.


To design a form and configure custom asset properties, follow these steps:




On the <Asset Name> tab, click 
Edit
.
For example, click 
Edit
 on the Business Term tab.
The <Asset Name>, tab contains the following sections:
Field Controls
: This pane displays the available UI elements.
Configure Form
: This pane is the canvas where you design the form using the UI elements available in the Field Controls pane.
Properties
: This pane displays the properties of the UI element selected in the Configure Form pane.


Drag and drop the required UI elements from the Field Controls pane to the Configure Form pane.


Select UI elements, one at a time, and configure their properties in the Properties pane.
The available properties differ based on the type of UI element.
Refer to the following table for property descriptions:

Configuring Data Profiling


 Data quality scores (DQ scores) enable you to measure your data's quality. A higher DQ score indicates better accuracy and completeness of the data. To provide data quality capabilities, 
erwin Data Intelligence
 (erwin DI) integrates erwin Data Quality as a data quality analysis partner. To run data quality profiling, you need to configure erwin Data Quality in your 
erwin DI
 application.


Configuring erwin Data Quality in 
erwin DI
 requires Client ID and Client Secret details available in your erwin Data Quality instance. To get configuration details from erwin Data Quality instance, refer to the 
Accessing erwin Data Qualitys Configuration Details
 section.


erwin Data Quality now supports Single Sign-On (SSO). For more information, refer to 
erwin Data Quality SSO  guide
