Additionally, you can also \nsave your searches as custom views\n to access them quickly in the future.\n\n\nTo search and filter assets, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nIn the search box, type a keyword. A list of related search terms appears. Select the required search term or enter a new one.\n\n\n\n\nTwo options, Like and Exact, appear. Use these options to narrow down the search results.\n\n\n\n\nLike\n\n\n\n\nUse this option to find assets that match a part of the search keyword.\n\n\n\n\nExact\n\n\n\n\nUse this option to find assets that exactly match the search keyword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \n or press \nEnter\n.\n\n\nBased on your search criteria, search results appear. \n\n\nFor example, in the following image, 442 results are displayed for a Like search with keyword, Customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the search box, click \nAll\n and select your asset type to filter search results further based on asset types. For example, Columns.\n\n\nThe list of available filters changes depending on asset type.\n\n\nFor example, for the keyword, Customer, and asset type, Columns, the Like search displays 294 results. Apart from the asset type, search results also display sensitivity classifications, tags, ratings, and workflow status.\n\n\nExecuting a Like search for a column displays results based on partial matches found in column name, logical column name, column definition, column comments, expanded logical name, and user-defined fields. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the search box, click \nColumns\n and Select \nAll\n to filter and search through all asset types.\n\n\nIn the filters pane under \nData Value Score\n, select score classifications, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results. You can view data value scores for different assets here based on the classifications you have selected in the Applied Filters list. \n\n\nFor example, in the following image, Bronze and Silver are added to the Applied Filters list, and the search result narrows down to 7 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the filters pane under \nMaturity Level\n, select maturity level classifications, and then click \nApply Filters\n. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\nThe selected classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.\n You can view maturity level certification for different assets here based on the classifications you have selected in the Applied Filters list. \nFor example, in the following image, Beginner and Intermediate are added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 4 results.\n\n\nAdditionally, to view the data value score and maturity level for a particular asset, under \nAsset Type\n, select the asset and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected asset is added to the Applied Filters list and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results. You can view data value score and maturity level for a particular asset here based on the classification and asset type you have selected in the Applied Filters list.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, Business Terms is added to the Applied Filters list along with Bronze and Intermediate, and the search result narrows down to 2 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Value Score and Maturity Level Certification are available for business and data marketplace assets such as business terms, business policies, datasets, and AI models.\n\n\nIn the filters pane under \nDatabase Type\n, select databases, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected databases are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, SqlServer and Oracle are added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 164 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \nSensitivity Classification\n, select sensitivity tags, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected sensitivity classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, a sensitivity classification, Confidential, is added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 13 records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \nTags\n, select user-defined tags, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected tags are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search result.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, a tag, Data Quality, is added to the Applied Filters list and the search result narrows down to 34 results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch \nShow My Favourites\n  on.\n\n\nMy Favourites is added to the Applied Filters list and matches based on these filters are displayed in the search result.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, My Favourites is added to the Applied Filters list, and the search result narrows down to 2 results.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can apply other filters available for an asset to narrow down search results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \n<Asset_Name>\n to view asset properties.\n\n\nFor example, in the following image, the properties of a column, CustomerTypeID are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Assets using Extended Properties\n\n\n You can configure extended properties of technical and business assets as filters and use them to filter assets. \n\n\nTo configure an extended property and use it in the Discover Assets module as filters, refer to the configuring extended properties for \nbusiness\n and \ntechnical\n assets topics.\n\n\nEnsure that the:\n\n\n\n\nFilter feature supports field types such dropdown, list, checkbox, radio, and boolean.\n\n\nSwitch the \nInclude Extended Properties\n option \nON\n on the \nDiscover Asset Settings\n page.\n\n\n Schedule a \nsynchronization job\n or manually synchronize\n the asset before you can filter assets on the Discover Assets module.\n\n\n\n\nTo filter assets based on the extended properties, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nBased on the selection on the Discover Assets dashboard, results are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the filter pane, the available custom filters appear below the default filter options. Custom filters are displayed in blue color. \n\n\nIn the filter pane, expand custom filters, select a filter parameter, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\nThe selected parameters are added in the Applied Filters list and matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.\nFor example, in the following image, CustomerAddress and CustomerNumber from the Must Include parameter are added to the Applied Filters list. This narrows the search results down to three results.\n \n\n\nSaving Searches as Custom Views\n\n\nYou can save your searches as custom views in Discover Assets dashboard and open these to access required results during subsequent visits. You can also choose if your custom view should be private or available to all users. Similarly, you can use views made by others if they have set the view to be available for all users. However, only the creator of the view can edit or delete it.\n\n\nTo save searches as custom views, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nSearch with a keyword and apply appropriate search filters to get the required results.\n\n\nClick \nSave As\n.\n\n\nThe Custom View screen appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter appropriate values in the fields. Refer to the following table for field descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies the name of the custom view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow To All Users\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies whether the view is available for all users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifies the details of the custom view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n.\n\n\nThe custom view is created.

For example, Columns.\n\n\nThe list of available filters changes depending on asset type.\n\n\nFor example, for the keyword, Customer, and asset type, Columns, the Like search displays 294 results. Apart from the asset type, search results also display sensitivity classifications, tags, ratings, and workflow status.\n\n\nExecuting a Like search for a column displays results based on partial matches found in column name, logical column name, column definition, column comments, expanded logical name, and user-defined fields. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the search box, click \nColumns\n and Select \nAll\n to filter and search through all asset types.\n\n\nIn the filters pane under \nData Value Score\n, select score classifications, and then click \nApply Filters\n.\n\n\nThe selected classifications are added to the Applied Filters list, and the matches based on these filters are displayed in the search results.
